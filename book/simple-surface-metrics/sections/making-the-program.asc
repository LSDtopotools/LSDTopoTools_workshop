=== Making the analysis driver program

LSDTopoTools is distributed as source code in pass:[C++], so you have to turn it into a program using a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler[compiler] and a program called `make`. Don't worry; this is rather painless. 

NOTE: It is easier to keep track of things if you have one terminal window for the directories with the source code (these are all in the `Git_projects` directory) and another terminal window inside directories where you keep your data (these are in the `Topographic_projects` directory). 

. Navigate into the `LSDTopoTools_AnalyisDriver` directory, and then into the subdirectory `Analysis_driver`. 
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd /path/to/LSDTopoTools/
$ cd Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver/Analysis_driver
----
+
The `/path/to/` bit can be replaced by your own path (in my case it is `/home/smudd/`). In vagrant this is simply `/` since our vagrant setup puts the `LSDTopoTools` directory within the root directory. 
+
. Then use `make` to compile the programs. You will get lots of warnings that can be ignored. 
+
[source,console]
----
$ make -f Drive_analysis_from_paramfile.make
----
+
. Once you have done this, you should see a file called `LSDTT_analysis_from_paramfile.out` in this directory. That is the program we will use to make some new topographic data!
