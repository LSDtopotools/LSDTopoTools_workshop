=== Making a curvature mask

In this next step we will use the curvature data to make a masked plot. Curvature is a metric that tells us about where there are fluvial vs hillslope processes happening in a landscape, and has been used to http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JF002057/abstract[infer erosion rates].

For this, we will use the *LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver* once again. 

Sadly, the `WAWater.bil` raster is produced from data that is not amenable to a good curvature map. It is produced by the Ordinance Survey using a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangulated_irregular_network[TIN] and so the landscape is made up of triangular facets that have anomalous curvature values at the intersections and no curvature on the faces. 

. You will need to run curvature on the `WA.bil` DEM instead. So make a copy of the driver file:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cp Workshop_AD_example.LSDTT_driver Workshop_WA_example.LSDTT_driver
----
+
. Now you just need to adjust a few parameters:
+
[source,console]
----
# This is a driver file for LSDTopoTools
# Any lines with the # symbol in the first row will be ignored

# File information
# IMPORTANT: you will need to modify the file path to reflect your directory structure
# NOTE: If you want to use a smaller test DEM use WA instead of WAWater
dem read extension: bil
dem write extension: bil
read path: /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/
write path: /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/
read fname: WA
write fname: WA

# Parameters for various topographic analysis
min_slope_for_fill: 0.0001

# Parameters for polyfit and slope calculations
polyfit_window_radius: 19
slope_method: polyfit

# The different analyses to be run
write hillshade: true
write slope: true
write curvature: true
----
+
. Now run this file:
+
[source,console]
----
$ ./LSDTT_analysis_from_paramfile.out /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/ Workshop_WA_example.LSDTT_driver 
----
+
. Once you've done this you should have a DEM called `WA_curvature`

==== Run the mask

. First, go into your data directory and make a another copy of the driver file:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cp Workshop_AD_example.LSDTT_driver Mask_example.LSDTT_driver
----
+
. Now you just need to adjust a few parameters:
+
[source,console]
----
# This is a driver file for LSDTopoTools
# Any lines with the # symbol in the first row will be ignored

# File information
# IMPORTANT: you will need to modify the file path to reflect your directory structure
# NOTE: If you want to use a smaller test DEM use WA instead of WAWater
dem read extension: bil
dem write extension: bil
read path: /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/
write path: /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/LSDTT_workshop_data/
read fname: WA_curvature
write fname: WA_curvature

# Parameters for masking
mask_threshold: 0
mask_nodataisbelowthreshold: 0

# The different analyses to be run
write mask threshold: true
----
+
. The differences here are that you are using the `WA_curvature` raster instead of the DEM, that you are trying to write a mask threshold, and you are going to turn anything that is over the threshold value of 0 into a `nodata` (that is, you tell the computer it doesn't have any data there).
+
. You can change this around a bit: if you run `mask_nodataisbelowthreshold: 1` it means anything below the threshold is masked, and you can change the threshold value by changing `mask_threshold:`.
+
. Once you have done this try loading into QGIS and looking at this data over the hillshade using transparency (in the *properties* menu: right-click on the layer).
