=== Looking at the first analysis in QGIS

We are going to look at some of the resulting rasters in QGIS. The main reason for using QGIS and not ArcMap is that QGIS is open source and you can download it onto your home computer. ArcMap needs an expensive license. However, if you want to use ArcMap the steps are similar (the buttons are just in slightly different places).

. In QGIS the add data button looks like this:
+
.Open raster data in QGIS

+
. Find the DEM (in the example `WAWater.bil`) and add it. 
+
. Once you add data you will see it in the layers toolbar:
+
.QGIS layers

+
You should see something like this:
+
.DEM of the Whiteadder Water, Scotland

+
. If you want to change the colours right click on the layers and select `properties`:
+
.Selecting the properties of a raster

+
. Then go into the `Style` menu and select `Singleband pseudocolor`
+
.Selecting the display of colours

+
. If you go to the "new color map" pull down you can select from a range of colormaps, and download yet even more by selecting "new color ramp" at the bottom. For topography the wiki-schwartzwald` gradient is nice. You can choose whichever one you want. 
+
.Selecting a colour ramp (including laoding new ones)

+
. To get this to work you then need to click on the *classify* button. Then click *apply*. You will get something like this:
+
.Whiteadder Water DEM in colour

+
. Following a similar procedure you can load the hillshade, slope and curvature maps, for example:
+
.Whiteadder Water hillshade

+
. If you want to make layers transparent, right click on the raster layer, select *preperties*, and select the *transparency* tab.
