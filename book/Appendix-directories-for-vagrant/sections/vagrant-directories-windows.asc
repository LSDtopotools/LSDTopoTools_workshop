=== Creating directories for Vagrant in Windows.

You could do all of the following steps using windows explorer, but the rationale here for doing it in a powershell is that you can copy and paste from these instructions to make sure the directory names are correct. 

. Open a powershell window. You can do this by clicking on the start button and typing "powershell". 
. Now go to the `C:\` directory:
+
[source,console]
----
PS > cd c:\
----
+
. Now make a directory called VagrantBoxes:
+
[source,console]
----
PS C:\> mkdir VagrantBoxes
----
+ 
. Go into this directory and then make two additional directories (the names are below):
+
[source,console]
----
PS C:\> cd VagrantBoxes
PS C:\VagrantBoxes> mkdir Ubuntu
PS C:\VagrantBoxes> mkdir LSDTopoTools
----
+ 
NOTE: You could call the "Ubuntu" folder anything you like (sometimes I call them Ubuntu64 or Ubuntu32) but the name of the *LSDTopoTools* folder is *ESSENTIAL": it has to be spelled exactly like that and is case sensitive (i.e., lsdtopotools or LSDtopotools will not work, it has to be *LSDTopoTools*).
+
. Now go into the "Ubuntu" folder and download
