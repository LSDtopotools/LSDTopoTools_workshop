=== Creating directories for Vagrant in MacOS.

WARNING: The author of this section does not use MacOS so these are actually educated guesses. In the future I hope to sit down with a Mac user and make sure it works but for now there is a possibility this won't work.

. Open a terminal window. I guess you use finder to do that. I wouldn't know since I don't use MacOS.

. Once you have a terminal window open, we are in Linux world since MacOS is written on top of Linux! Yay! It is so nice to be in a familiar operating system (for me, at least.)
+
We are going to put stuff into your "home" directory. Go there by typing this:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~
----
+
. Now make a directory called VagrantBoxes:
+
[source,console]
----
$ mkdir VagrantBoxes
----
+ 
. Go into this directory and then make two additional directories (the names are below):
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd VagrantBoxes
$ mkdir Ubuntu
$ mkdir LSDTopoTools
----
+ 
NOTE: You could call the "Ubuntu" folder anything you like (sometimes I call them Ubuntu64 or Ubuntu32) but the name of the *LSDTopoTools* folder is *ESSENTIAL": it has to be spelled exactly like that and is case sensitive (i.e., lsdtopotools or LSDtopotools will not work, it has to be *LSDTopoTools*).
+
. Now go into the Ubuntu folder (or whatever you called it) and get one of our vagrantfiles using *wget*. You will need to be online to do this:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd Ubuntu
$ wget https://www.github.io/LSDTopoTools/LSDVagrantFiles/raw/
