=== Setting up directories

This is **ESSENTIAL**. If you don't know where your files are it will lead to extreme frustration! You will need to work with files and directories in Linux. There is a http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_setting_up_your_file_system_and_keeping_it_clean_strong_essential_reading_if_you_are_new_to_linux_strong[entire section in our book] about this. 

The crucial thing is that we will have deparate directories for **DATA** and **PROGRAMS**. So you will need to make directories for these. 

For the purposes of this workshop, we will use a standardised directory structure. If you **NOT** at Edinburgh and using our vagrant setup, then this structure already exists!! If you are at Edinburgh you will need to make this structure. 

NOTE: In Linux, to find out your current directory type the command `pwd`.

==== Directories if you are at Edinburgh

. If you have just started an ssh or terminal window, you can find out where you are, it will look something like this:
+
[source,console]
----
$ pwd
$ /home/MyUserName/
----
+
In this case `MyUserName` will be replaced by your own EASE name (e.g., smudd)
+
. Make a directory called `LSDTopoTools` using the `mkdir` and then go into it with the `cd` command:
+
[source,console]
----
$ mkdir LSDTopoTools
$ cd LSDTopoTools
$ pwd
$ /home/MyUserName/LSDTopoTools/
----
+
IMPORTANT: Linux is case sensitive so `LSDTopoTools` and `lsdtopotools` and `LSDtopotools` are three different directories!! Make sure you keep track of this!
+
WARNING: **DO NOT** use spaces in your file or directory names, **EVER.**
+
. Now make two new directories in the `LSDTopoTools` directory
