=== Setting up directories

**LSDTopoTools** expects your data to be organised in a certain way. You can either do this yourself by hand (we will call this the "hard way") or use a python script we have prepared ("easy way"). If you follow directions to set up the easy way you don't need to follow instructions for the hard way. 

==== Setting up directories the easy way

IMPORTANT: If you justy plan on using the tools this is the way to set up **LSDTopoTools**. You really only need to read the sections about doing things the hard way if you are going to be doing developemtn of our software, or are going to be using our new releases of research code.

. The first thing you need to do is get our python program *LSDTopoToolsSetUp.py*. 

==== Setting up directories the hard way

This is **ESSENTIAL**. If you don't know where your files are it will lead to extreme frustration! You will need to work with files and directories in Linux. There is a http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_setting_up_your_file_system_and_keeping_it_clean_strong_essential_reading_if_you_are_new_to_linux_strong[entire section in our book] about this. 

The crucial thing is that we will have deparate directories for **DATA** and **PROGRAMS**. So you will need to make directories for these. 

For the purposes of this workshop, we will use a standardised directory structure. If you **NOT** at Edinburgh and using our vagrant setup, then this structure already exists!! If you are at Edinburgh you will need to make this structure. 

NOTE: In Linux, to find out your current directory type the command `pwd`.

.How directories are organised and how to move around in them
*****************************************************
Inside your computer are files organised into directories (in Windows these are called folders, but the concept is the same). These can be nested, so a directory can contain other directories. 

One way of thinking about this is like the root system of a tree. Directories inside other directories are like branching roots. If you start at the tip of the system and keep going up you get to the biggest root. In Linux the top directory is called *root*: it contains all the other directories. So when we say you are going "down" is means you are getting into smaller and smaller directories, and if you are going "up" it means you are getting closer to the root, where there are directories that connect to more stuff (i.e., they connect to more "branches".) 

* To go "up" you type the command `cd ..` The `cd` stands for "change directory". 
* To go "down" you need to choose one of the branches: `cd A_directory_name` where `A_directory_name` can be the name of any directory within your current directory.
* To see what is in a directory use `ls`. If you want lots of details type `ls -l`. 
* To see what directory you are in type `pwd`
*****************************************************

==== Directories if you are at Edinburgh the hard way

. If you have just started an ssh or terminal window, you can find out where you are, it will look something like this:
+
[source,console]
----
$ pwd
$ /home/MyUserName/
----
+
In this case `MyUserName` will be replaced by your own EASE name (e.g., smudd)
+
. Make a directory called `LSDTopoTools` using the `mkdir` command and then go into it with the `cd` command:
+
[source,console]
----
$ mkdir LSDTopoTools
$ cd LSDTopoTools
$ pwd
$ /home/MyUserName/LSDTopoTools/
----
+
IMPORTANT: Linux is case sensitive so `LSDTopoTools` and `lsdtopotools` and `LSDtopotools` are three different directories!! Make sure you keep track of this!
+
WARNING: **DO NOT** use spaces in your file or directory names, **EVER.**
+
. Now make two new directories in the `LSDTopoTools` directory, called `Git_projects` and `Topographic_projects`. The only reason for these names is that the rest of the documentation uses these directory names. 
+
[source,console]
----
$ pwd
$ /home/MyUserName/LSDTopoTools/
$ mkdir Git_projects
$ mkdir Topographic_projects
----
+
. We are going to clone some data into the `Topographic_projects` directory. Even if you are going to use your own DEM this is handy because the cloned data folder also includes all the parameter files that we will use in this workshop:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd Topographic_projects
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_workshop_data.git
----
+ 
. This will make a folder `LSDTT_workshop_data` into which you can place your own data. It also contains two test DEMs from Scotland that we will use in the Eroding Landscapes course. 
+
. Now go back into your `Git_projects` directory. If you hve followed the above directions you will be sitting in the `Topographic_projects` directory so go up a level and then down into the `Git_projects` directory:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ..
$ cd Git_projects
----
+
. Now you need to clone some other repositories that have our code:
+
[source,console]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver.git
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_CRNBasinwide.git
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction.git
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014.git
----
+
. Great! Now you have everything you need for the workshop. 

==== Directories if you are outside Edinburgh (or using your home computer) the hard way

If you have set up using our https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_vagrantfiles[vagrantfiles], the correct directory structre is already in place. However you will need to clone the data for this workshop:

[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects
$ git clone https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_workshop_data.git
----
 
==== Directory structure

You directories should look like this after you have made them:

[source,console]
----
/LSDTopoTools
  |--Git_projects
  |----LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver
  |----LSDTopoTools_CRNBasinwide
  |----LSDTopoTools_ChannelExtraction
  |----LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014
  |--Topographic_projects
  |----LSDTT_workshop_data
  |----Test_data
----
