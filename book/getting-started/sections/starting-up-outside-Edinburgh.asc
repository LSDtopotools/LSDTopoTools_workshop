=== Starting up outside Edinburgh

If you are not in the School of GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh, you will need to set up your own Linux environment. The full instructions can be found at this website: 
http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_installing_lsdtopotools_using_virtualbox_and_vagrant

Below are quick instructions. If you have trouble, follow the link above and then go through the complete instructions. 


.Quick Instructions for using Vagrant for LSDTopoTools
************************************************
. Download and install https://www.virtualbox.org/[virtualbox].
. Download and install https://www.vagrantup.com/[vagrant]. You might have to restart your computer after this. 
. If you are on Windows, download http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html[putty.exe]. If you are on Linux or MacOS you can skip this (they have built-in equivalents).
. Make a folder for your vagrant box. We tend to put ours in a directory called `VagrantBoxes`.
. Inside that directory make two new directories: `LSDTopoTools` and `Ubuntu_vagrant`. The second directory's name doesn't matter, it is just for holding a vagrant file (see below). However you **MUST** have the `LSDTopoTools` directory. The directory name is **case sensitive**!
. Download one of our vagrantfiles: https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTT_vagrantfiles into the `Ubuntu_vagrant` directory (again, the name of the directory doesn't matter).
. Rename the vagrantfile from the repo (either `Vagrantfile_32bit_FFTW` or `Vagrantfile_64bit_FFTW`) simply `vagrantfile`. Your operating system is almost certainly 64 bit, but on most computers you need to select 32 bit because the default setting is to disable 64 bit guest operating systems. This can be changed but only by expert users. 
. Open a terminal or powershell window and navigate to the directory with the vagrantfile. 
. Run `vagrant up` from the command line. 
+
WARNING: If you are running `vagrant up` for the first time it can take some time to download the https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/boxes.html[base box]. They are several hundred Mb each!
+
. Run `vagrant provision` after the box has started. 
. If on Windows, you should now be able to use `putty.exe` to ssh into your LSDTopoTools server. The host name is almost always `127.0.0.1` and the port is almost always `2222`. 
. On Windows, you will need to give a username and password after connecting using `putty.exe`. The machnie is running locally on your computer so nothing is being sent over the internet. The username is always `vagrant` and the password is also `vagrant`. 
. If you are on OS X or Linux you do not need `putty.exe`; all you need to do is type `vagrant ssh` into the command line. See the https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/up.html[vagrant instructions].

=== Troubleshooting a vagrant server

There are a few common problems people have when running a vagrant server. 

* If you are on an old computer, sometimes vagrant times out before the virtual machine boots. This most frequently happens the first time you boot a vagrant machine. The most effective way to fix this is with the canonical IT solution: turning it off and on again. TO do that run `vagrant halt` and `vagrant up` in succesion. 
* If your files are not synching across your host and vagrant machine, it is probably because there is some misspelling in your `LSDTopoTools` folder on the host machine. Make sure that folder is in the correct place and is spelled correctly (remember it should be case sensitive!!). 

==== After you have set up a vagrant server

Once you have a vagrant server set up, you should start **TWO** ssh sessions into the Linux server.
