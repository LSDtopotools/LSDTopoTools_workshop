=== Starting up at Edinburgh

If you are at Edinburgh, most of the software you need for *LSDTopoTools* is already installed on our servers. So the main task you will have to get started is getting on to our servers.

NOTE: If you are not going to use University of Edinburgh servers (e.g., you want to work on your own computer or are not affiliated with the University of Edinburgh) you should skip to skip to the section on <<Starting up outside Edinburgh>>.

If you are on a desktop, you will need the program https://www.nomachine.com/download[NX]. Using this program you can log in to our https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell[ssh] portal. The instructions are here: http://www.ed.ac.uk/geosciences/intranet/it/working-remotely

Once you get into NX, you should open **TWO** terminal windows. To open a terminal window in nx just right click and select "terminal".

==== If NX is not working

Sometimes NX misbehaves, so you can also use a secure shell client. Our lab computers have something called either *SSH client* or *SSH Secure Shell*: select the client on the start menu and then begin a new session. You will need to use the address `ssh.geos.ed.ac.uk`, and then your username, and click on password control. You will then need to enter your EASE password at the prompt. You should start **TWO** sessions. These windows are the equivalent of a terminal window in NX. 

=== Move onto a decent server

When you start up in either NX or an SSH client, you get dumped onto an old, slow server. To switch to a new, faster one, you need to use the `ssh` command:

[source, console]
----
$ ssh achray.geos.ed.ac.uk
----

or simply

[source, console]
----
$ ssh achray
----

You might need to enter your EASE password again here.
