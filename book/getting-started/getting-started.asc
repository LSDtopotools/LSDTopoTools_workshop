== Getting Started

Welcome to a short course on http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools]. There are three collections of people who might be taking this course:

. Research students and staff at the University of Edinburgh
. Students taking Eroding Landscapes at the University of Edinburgh
. People from outside of Edinburgh who want to learn how to use LSDTopoTools

The main difference between these groups is that if you are at Edinburgh you can use our Linux servers and if you are not you will need to set up your own Linux server on your desktop computer or laptop using a clever bit of softwre called https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] that works on any operating system (e.g., Windows, Linx, or MacOS).

=== Summary

I can summarize a chapter here. But in the United Kingdom I summarise things.
