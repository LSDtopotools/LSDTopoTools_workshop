== Getting Started

Welcome to this short course on http://lsdtopotools.github.io/[LSDTopoTools]. There are three collections of people who might be taking this course:

. Research students and staff at the University of Edinburgh.
. Students taking Eroding Landscapes and other taught students (BSc, MSc, MEarthSci) at the University of Edinburgh. 
. People from outside of Edinburgh who want to learn how to use **LSDTopoTools**.

The main difference between these groups is that if you are at Edinburgh you can use our Linux servers and if you are not you will need to set up your own Linux server on your desktop computer or laptop using a clever bit of softwre called https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]. Don't worry if that sounds a bit complex, we have instructions to walk you through the process, which works on any operating system (e.g., Windows, Linux, or MacOS) and is all based on open-source software. 

The only substantive difference between taught students and research students at Edinburgh is the amount of disk storage you are allocated on our servers. If you are a taught student and are going to be using large datasets you should either install **LSDTopoTools** on your own computer or talk to the GeoSciences IT team about getting more storage.
