=== Get some data

The first thing you need is to get some data! I am going to use http://www.opentopography.org/[OpenTopography] since it has a nice interface for https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/index.html[SRTM] data and it can give you seamless data without having to create a user account. 

. First, go to the http://www.opentopography.org/[OpenTopography] and hover over the *Data* button so that you can select *Raster* data:
+
.Select raster from opentopography

+
. Now Click on the *Global Data* tab and select the 30m data:
+
.Select SRTM 30

+
. You end up with a map of the world. Zoom in to where you want data (I'll use a place in Taiwan) and then use the *select region* tab to select a region. If you don't get the correct region the first time just click the select region button and try again:
+
.Select region

+
. Once you have done this scroll down, select the GeoTiff opion, decide if you want a hillshade or not, and then enter a job description and your email:
+
.Select name
image::images/select_name.jpg[Select job name]
+
. Once you finish that you will need to wait a bit until you get a link to the data (in this case it took 6 seconds to gather the data):
+
.Raster report
