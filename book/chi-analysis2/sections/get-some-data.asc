=== Get some data

The first thing you need is to get some data! I am going to use http://www.opentopography.org/[OpenTopography] since it has a nice interface for https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/index.html[SRTM] data and it can give you seamless data without having to create a user account. 

. First, go to the http://www.opentopography.org/[OpenTopography] and hover over the *Data* button so that you can select *Raster* data:
+
.Select raster from opentopography
image::images/select_raster.jpg[Select raster data]
+
. Now Click on the *Global Data* tab and select the 30m data:
+
.Select SRTM 30
image::images/select_30.jpg[Select 30 m data]
+
. You end up with a map of the world. Zoom in to where you want data (I'll use a place in Taiwan) and then use the *select region* tab to select a region. If you don't get the correct region the first time just click the select region button and try again:
+
.Select region
image::images/select_region.jpg[Select region]
+
. Once you have done this scroll down, select the GeoTiff opion, decide if you want a hillshade or not, and then enter a job description and your email:
+
.Select name
image::images/select_name.jpg[Select job name]
+
. Once you finish that you will need to wait a bit until you get a link to the data (in this case it took 6 seconds to gather the data):
+
.Raster report
image::images/raster_report.jpg[Done getting data]
+
. Download this into a data folder. If you are using our http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_installing_lsdtopotools_using_virtualbox_and_vagrant[vagrant setup] you need to download this file into a folder that is visible to the vagrant machine. I use the convention of putting my vagrant files in `C:\VagrantBoxes\LSDTopoTools`, and for this example I will download the file into `C:\VagrantBoxes\LSDTopoTools\Topographic_projects\Taiwan\`:
+
.Download to a sensible directory.

+
. Now start up your vagrant machine and log into it via `putty.exe` (if you don't know how to do this read the chapter <<Starting up outside Edinburgh>>). 
+
. In a putty window, navigate to the directory where the data is:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Topographic_projects/Taiwan/
$ ls
rasters_srtm.tar.gz
----
+
. Okay, the file is inside your linux machine! This file has the extension `.tar.gz` meaning that it is a zipped tarball. You need to unzip and untar it. This is easy in linux:
+
[source,console]
----
$ tar -zvxf rasters_srtm.tar.gz
$ ls
rasters_srtm.tar.gz output_srtm.tif
----
+ 
. Yay! You now have a tif file called `output_srtm.tif`! 

=== Preprocessing your DEM

I'm afraid you are not finished once you have your DEM. *LSDTopoTools* eats https://www.harrisgeospatial.com/docs/ENVIImageFiles.html[ENVI bil] files, and it wants files projected into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system[UTM] coordinates. We are going to fix this problem in one go with http://www.gdal.org/[gdal]. You need to know the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system#UTM_zone[UTM zone] of your study site, which you can look up here: http://www.dmap.co.uk/utmworld.htm It happens that Taiwan is in UTM zone 51. 

. You can look at all the fancy stuff that gdal does in this chapter of our main book: http://lsdtopotools.github.io/LSDTT_book/#_gdal_2 For now, however, you can just translate your file using this command:
+
[source,console]
----
$ gdalwarp -t_srs '+proj=utm +zone=51 +datum=WGS84' -r cubic -dstnodata -9999 -of ENVI
output_srtm.tif Taiwan.bil
----
+
. The `-t_srs` flag says you want a target reference system. The next bit (`'+proj=utm +zone=51 +datum=WGS84'`) is the reference system you choose (if you download a different place you need to change the zone). The `-r` flag is the resampling method (use `cubic` or `bilinear` if you don't want striping), `-dstnodata -9999` means you should set the no data values to -9999 and `-of ENVI` means that your output file should be in ENVI format. The final two things are the input file (`output_srtm.tif`) and the output file (`Taiwan.bil`).
+ 
. When we look at the resulting DEM, we find the vexing problem that the ocean is at zero elevation. This problem is quite common so we have a program for dealing with it called `dem_preprocessing.exe`. 
+
. Open a new putty terminal and navigate to the *analysis driver* folder:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd /LSDTopoTools/Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_AnalysisDriver/Analysis_driver
----
+
. Now call `make` to make the program
+
[source,console]
----
$ make -f DEM_preprocessing.make
----
+
. Like almost all of our programs, you need to give `DEM_preprocessing.exe` a parameter file.
