== Chi mapping part 2: a full walkthrough 

As in the previous section, we will use the https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014[LSDTopoTools chi tool] program to calculate a map of chi (a Greek letter pronounced "kai") and chi slope. This section, however, is a full walkthrough of getting data (we use https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/cbanddataproducts.html[SRTM version 2 30 metre data]) to visualising the results. 

=== First steps

We assume you have 

1. A working version of *LSDTopoTools*, either in your own linux machine or by following these instructions: <<Setting up directories the easy way,setting up directories the easy way>>
2. A compiled version of the *chi tool* (if you ran the script https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/blob/master/LSDTopoToolsSetup.py[LSDTopoToolsSetup.py] it will have compiled the program for you).

=== Summary

By the end of this chapter you should have created a map of chi and chi slope, and loaded these data into QGIS for inspection.
