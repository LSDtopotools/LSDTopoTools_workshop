== Basin averaging

In many applications it is useful to visualise and analyse basin-averaged landscape properties. We have built a tool for averaging landscape properties over basins called the *basin average tool*. The functioning of this tool is very similar to the *chi tool* from the previous section, and if you have follwed instructions for that section the operation of the *basin average tool* should be familiar to you.
