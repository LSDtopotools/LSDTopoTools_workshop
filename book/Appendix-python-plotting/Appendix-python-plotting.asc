== Plotting LSDTopoTools output with Python

Much more effort has been put into DEM analysis with *LSDTopoTools* than visualisation since outputs are readable by GIS software such as https://www.qgis.org[QGIS] and https://www.arcgis.com/[ArcGIS]. 
However we do have some https://www.python.org/[python] scripts that are aimed at creating perfectly reproducible figures. This appendix will give some of the basics of using our visualisation scripts. 

WARNING: This component of *LSDTopoTools* is under constant development and is therefore quite buggy. The basic functions should be accessible to new user but it will help if you know some python. You might try to learn via https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python[codeacademy].
