=== LSDTopoTools python plotting functions

I am afraid this is a bit disorganised, since it has developed organically and we haven't had time to clean everything up. 

You should get our plotting and mapping tools from our https://github.com/LSDtopotools[github repositories]. Here is the next irritation: if you are using a vagrant server, the tool https://git-scm.com/[*git*] is installed on your Linux server. But we suggest you run python in your host operating system (e.g., Windows). Meaning you should install *git* on your host operating system. 

==== Getting git

* Linux: *git* is probably already on your system but if not you can install with any package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install git`).

* Windows: Download and install https://git-scm.com/download/win[git for Windows].

* MacOS: Download and install https://git-scm.com/download/mac[git for MacOS].

==== Getting our plotting tools

. Make a directory to hold the plotting tools. I usually call the directory for git projects "Git_projects".
. In Windows, right click on this directory and select "Git bash here". For this to work you will have needed to have installed *git for Windows* first. 
. In Linux or MacOS, open a terminal and go to this folder. 
. Clone our plotting repositories from github (this grabs the files from https://github.com/[github]):

. Getting files from github. In MacOS and linux the prompt will be `$`, in powershell it will be `PS>`.
