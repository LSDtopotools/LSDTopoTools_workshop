== Chi mapping

In this section we will use the https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014[LSDTopoTools chi tool] program to calculate a map of chi (a Greek letter pronounced "kai") and chi slope. Chi slope is an indicator of how steep the channel is normalised for drainage area, and the chi coordinate by itself can be used to infer drainage capture and divide migration.

=== Summary

By the end of this chapter you should have created a map of chi and chi slope, and loaded these data into QGIS for inspection.
