=== Looking at the chi map in QGIS

One we run the analysis, we can have a look at the results in QGIS. The teps will be similar in ArcMap, but we show QGIS here since it is open source. 

. In QGIS the add data button looks like this:
+
.Open raster data in QGIS
image::images/QGIS_add_data.jpg[Add data]
+
. Find the data rasters and add them:
.. `WA_DArea.bil`
.. `WA_SO.bil`
+
. To change the styling of these, see the section <<Looking at the first analysis in QGIS>>.
+
. Here is a coloured version of the stream order raster:
+
.Stream orders over the elevation raster of the Killmade Burn, Scotland

==== Adding csv data

. It is a bit more difficult to add csv data (csv stands for comma separated values). In QGIS, you need to click on the layer menu and then scroll to the `add text delimeted layer` button:
+
.Add csv data
image::images/Add_csv_layer.jpg[Add csv]
+
. We will add the `WA_MChiSegmented.csv` layer. Once you select that file (using `browse`) you will see something like this:
+
.Create layer menu

+
. Hit okay. You will then be asked what https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system[coordinate system] you want. **All csv data from LSDTopoTools is in the WGS84 coordinate system!** Your rasters are typically in a local coordinate system but we convert point data to WGS84 so that they can be loaded onto web mapping platforms (i.e., Google Earth). The upshot is that you need to use WGS84 for the coordinate system. 
+
. All coordinate systems have a code, called an EPSG code, and the EPSG code for WGS84 is *4326*: search for this (in the `Filter` form) and select it:
+
.Choose WGS 84 coordintate system with EPSG:4325

+
. You should get something that looks like this:
+
.Point data

+
WARNING: Sometimes you need to click in the little symbol that looks like a globe in the bottom right corner of QGIS an enable `on the fly CRS transformation`. 
+
. Okay, this doesn't look so great, right click on properties of the layer, choose *graduated* symbols, select the `m_chi` column (this is chi slope) pick a nice colour ramp, and then click on classify:
+
.Chi map coloured by chi steepness
