=== Making the chi tools

If you have jumped directly here, LSDTopoTools is distributed as source code in pass:[C++], so you have to turn it into a program using a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler[compiler] and a program called `make`. There is an easy way to do this, using a python script called https://github.com/LSDtopotools/LSDAutomation/blob/master/LSDTopoToolsSetup.py[LSDTopoToolsSetup.py], or you can do it one step at a time using `make`. 

==== Making chi tools using LSDTopoToolsSetup

. If you followed the directions on <<Setting up directories the easy way,setting up directories the easy way>>, you will already have the chi tools set up!
. If you haven't already set things up with this file, download it and run *EITHER*:
+
[source,console]
----
$ python LSDTopoToolsSetup.py -id 0
----
+
*OR*
+
[source,console]
----
$ python LSDTopoToolsSetup.py -id 1
----
+
+
. Doing this will set up *LSDTopoTools* in the root directory (in Vagrant). If you are not in vagrant, running it with `-id 0` it put LSDTopoTools in your root directory (in any other Linux system), whereas `-id 1` will put it in the directory from which you called `LSDTopoToolsSetup.py`. In vagrant, to get to the root just type:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd /
----
+
To get to your home directory just type:
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd ~
----


==== Making chi tools using `make`

The python script `LSDTopoToolsSetup.py` automates compilation of our source code, but in some cases you might want to compile things on your own (particularly if you start making changes to the source code). 

. Navigate into the `LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014` directory, and then into the subdirectory `driver_functions_MuddChi2014`. 
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd /path/to/LSDTopoTools/
$ cd Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014/driver_functions_MuddChi2014
----
+
The `/path/to/` bit can be replaced by your own path (in my case it is `/home/smudd/`). In vagrant this is simply `/` since our vagrant setup puts the `LSDTopoTools` directory within the root directory. 
+
. Then use `make` to compile the programs. You will get lots of warnings that can be ignored. 
+
[source,console]
----
$ make -f chi_mapping_tool.make
----
+
. Once you have done this, you should see a file called `LSDTT_analysis_from_paramfile.out` in this directory. That is the program we will use to make some new topographic data!
