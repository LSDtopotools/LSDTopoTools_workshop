=== Making the chi tools

If you have jumped directly here, LSDTopoTools is distributed as source code in pass:[C++], so you have to turn it into a program using a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler[compiler] and a program called `make`. Don't worry; this is rather painless. 

. Navigate into the `LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014` directory, and then into the subdirectory `driver_functions_MuddChi2014`. 
+
[source,console]
----
$ cd /path/to/LSDTopoTools/
$ cd Git_projects/LSDTopoTools_ChiMudd2014/driver_functions_MuddChi2014
----
+
The `/path/to/` bit can be replaced by your own path (in my case it is `/home/smudd/`). In vagrant this is simply `/` since our vagrant setup puts the `LSDTopoTools` directory within the root directory. 
+
. Then use `make` to compile the programs. You will get lots of warnings that can be ignored. 
+
[source,console]
----
$ make -f chi_mapping_tool.make
----
+
. Once you have done this, you should see a file called `LSDTT_analysis_from_paramfile.out` in this directory. That is the program we will use to make some new topographic data!
